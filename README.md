# Awesome Geometric Algebra/Calculus

## The Vision

This is not going to be just another curated list of Geometric Algebra/Calculus resources inspired by [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) lists, and it will not be just maintaining one `README.md`.

The preliminary result of this work is rendered at https://awesome-geometric-algebra.rtfd.io . There's almost nothing yet.

The vision for this work is:

- **Citation-based**: every resource colleted here will use [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/sphinxcontrib-bibtex) to maintain the citations in the familiar form of `.bib` files, including books, papers, articles and online resources like online pdf files, blog posts, videos, as well as software packages.
- **Web-based**: almost all of the citations will have the "url" property, at least linking to related information if not directly consumable. 
- **Multi-perspective**: every resource colleted here thus can be referenced by label multiple times like in a paper, so it can live in different "lists" from different angles.
- **Broader view**: Geometric Algebra is related to many areas of Mathematics, and has applications in Physics, Computer Science and other areas, and its pros and cons can only be identified in a broader view.
- **Demonstrated**: with the help of [nbsphinx](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/) and [Jupyter kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) or [Julia bridge](https://github.com/JuliaInterop) for Python, Julia, Javascript, Haskell, C++, Mathematica etc., existing software packages of Geometric Algebra written in different languages will be demonstrated in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, verified by CI, and a running environment will be setup in cloud [IDE](https://gitpod.io), [REPL](https://repl.it/) or [Jupyter services](https://mybinder.org/) (if no proprietary software are involved), just one click away.
